Vulpes-Development
==================

Hi there! This is my development website. 
I am of the belief that if you're going to have an online portfolio, 
make the website itself a part of your portfolio. 
This repository is mainly just for storage and syncing updated files.
My website is part of my personal ongoing project to make
a website that looks and functions as an operating system in-browser
The end-goal is to make the website more responsive, and have a mobile
version that appears as a mobile OS
